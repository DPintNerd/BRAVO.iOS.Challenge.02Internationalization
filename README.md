# Nerdery Internationalization Challenge

Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to make a calculator app for figuring out hours in the future from the current date and time. The catch, the application should be fully internationalized. The application should be localized into one other language (online tools are fine for this)

## Requirements

The top box (labeled Display Today's Date) should display the current date as of when the `applicationWillBecomeActive` notification fires. This should include the full date and time.

The middle box is your delta field. This field is your typical calculator input and will display the current delta in hours. For examples of scenarios on how this changes, reference the calculator app. 

The last box on top (Display calculated date) will display the first box plus the the second box. This should be displayed as the full date and time

The bottom elements are a calculator pad, just like you'd see in any calculator.
